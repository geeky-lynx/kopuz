//! Finding artist photos.
//!
//! Two shapes, chosen by the source's capability rather than its identity: a
//! `Library` server answers with one bulk listing, a `Remote` catalog (YT) has
//! to be asked per artist. Both write what they find into the library, so the
//! next open resolves instantly instead of searching again.
//!
//! A definitive "no photo exists" is recorded too, with a day's TTL. Without
//! that, every visit re-searches the same artists -- most of a local library's
//! artists have no photo anywhere, and the search is a network round trip
//! each.
//!
//! This ran in the app, holding results in a session map the grid read
//! alongside the persisted one. It writes only to the library now: the daemon
//! announces the change and every frontend re-reads, so a photo found while
//! one window was open shows up in the others too.
