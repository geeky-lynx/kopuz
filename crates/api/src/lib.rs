//! Wire types and the client-facing trait for the Kopuz daemon API.
//!
//! Everything here is transport-neutral: `LocalApi` (daemon crate) implements
//! [`KopuzApi`] with direct in-process calls; `GrpcApi` (client crate)
//! implements it over the gRPC wire. The protobuf schema in `kopuz-proto` is
//! the versioned wire contract.
//!
//! The trait starts with the playback core and grows one resource group at a
//! time as the daemon services land.
